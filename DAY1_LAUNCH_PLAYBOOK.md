Title: Built a free tool for finding arbitrage opportunities - looking for feedback

Hey r/sportsbook,

I've been working on a side project that monitors odds across multiple
sportsbooks in real-time to find arbitrage opportunities and steam moves.

What it does:
- Compares odds across 15+ books
- Alerts on profitable arb opportunities
- Tracks line movements (steam moves)
- Free tier available

Would love feedback from the community. What features would make this
more useful for your betting?

Link: https://roizenlabs.com

Not trying to spam - genuinely looking for input from people who actually bet.

discrepancies before they disappear.

The edge sharp bettors use - now accessible to everyone.

Free tier available: https://roizenlabs.com

### 11:00 - Educational Thread (Twitter)
```
Thread: What is a steam move?

1/ When sharp money hits a line, ALL books adjust quickly.

2/ But they don't all move at the same speed.

3/ If you see Book A move first, you have seconds to bet Book B at the old line.

4/ This is how sharps make money. We track this in real-time.

5/ Try it free: https://roizenlabs.com
