Title: Built a free tool for finding arbitrage opportunities - looking for feedback

Hey r/sportsbook,

I've been working on a side project that monitors odds across multiple
sportsbooks in real-time to find arbitrage opportunities and steam moves.

What it does:
- Compares odds across 15+ books
- Alerts on profitable arb opportunities
- Tracks line movements (steam moves)
- Free tier available

Would love feedback from the community. What features would make this
more useful for your betting?

Not trying to spam - genuinely looking for input from people who
actually bet.

## PHASE 2: WEEK 1 SPRINT

### Day 1-2: Analytics Setup
```
Priority: Add tracking BEFORE marketing push

Option A: Plausible Analytics (Privacy-focused, $9/mo)
- Go to plausible.io
- Add site: meek-caramel-2b88d7.netlify.app
- Add script to dashboard/index.html

Option B: PostHog (Free tier, more features)
- Go to posthog.com
- Create project
- Add tracking snippet
```

### Day 2-3: Content Blitz

**Twitter Content Queue (Schedule 2-3/day):**

Tweet 1 - Problem/Solution:
```
Most arb opportunities disappear in under 60 seconds.

That's why we built real-time monitoring.

SportIntel scans 15+ sportsbooks every second so you don't have to.
```

Tweet 2 - Social Proof:
```
Today's stats from SportIntel:

Arbitrage opportunities found: [X]
Average profit margin: [X]%
Fastest arb closed in: [X] seconds

The edge is real. Are you capturing it?
```

Tweet 3 - Education:
```
What is a steam move?

When sharp money hits a line, ALL books adjust quickly.

If you see Book A move first, you have seconds to bet Book B at the old line.

This is how sharps make money. We track it in real-time.
```

Tweet 4 - Feature Highlight:
```
New: Live odds ticker

Watch lines move in real-time across all major sportsbooks.

No more tab-switching. No more missed opportunities.

### Day 3-4: Influencer Outreach

5. Share value, not links
```

**Subreddits to monitor:**
