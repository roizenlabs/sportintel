## STEP 3: Pre-Launch Prep (Do Today)

### Follow Strategic Accounts (50-100)
Follow these types of accounts:

**Sports Betting Influencers:**
- Search "sports betting tips" - follow top creators
- Search "arbitrage betting" - follow anyone active
- Search "sharp betting" - these are your people

**Betting Communities:**
- @ActionNetworkHQ
- @BettingPros
- @TheLines
- @OddsChecker
- Any sportsbook official accounts

**Tech/Startup Accounts:**
- @ProductHunt

- Founders in betting/fintech space

### Engage Before You Post (Critical!)
Spend 30-60 minutes:
1. Reply to 10-15 tweets in the betting space
2. Add VALUE in replies (not "nice!" but actual insights)
3. Quote tweet interesting takes with your perspective

Example valuable replies:
```
"This is why real-time monitoring matters. By the time you manually
check 5 books, the arb is gone. Speed is everything."

"The steam move tells you where sharp money went. The question is:
can you bet the other books before they adjust?"

"Most people don't realize arbs close in under 60 seconds.
Manual hunting doesn't work at scale."
```

## STEP 5: Ready-to-Use Content

### Launch Day Tweets

**6 AM - Main Announcement:**
```
Introducing SportIntel

Real-time arbitrage detection across 15+ sportsbooks.

Find profitable opportunities before they disappear.

Free tier available - no credit card required.

https://roizenlabs.com
```

**9 AM - Educational:**
```
What is arbitrage betting?

When different sportsbooks have odds that guarantee profit regardless of outcome.

Example:
- Book A: Team X +150
- Book B: Team Y +160

Bet both sides = guaranteed profit.

The catch? These close in seconds.

That's why we built @SportIntelHQ
```

**12 PM - Stats:**
```
This morning alone:

23 arbitrage opportunities detected
Average profit margin: 2.1%
Fastest arb closed in: 18 seconds

This is why manual arb hunting doesn't work.

Real-time alerts > spreadsheets
```

**3 PM - Demo:**
```
Watch this:

[Screenshot of dashboard]

Every green row = money left on the table if you're not monitoring.

SportIntel scans 15+ sportsbooks every second.

Try it free: roizenlabs.com
```

**6 PM - Social Proof:**
```
"I spent 2 hours a day checking odds across books.
Now I get alerts when there's actually an opportunity."

This is what we built SportIntel for.

Time is your most valuable asset. Stop wasting it on manual comparisons.
```

**9 PM - Engagement:**
```
Question for bettors:

What's your biggest frustration with finding +EV bets?

A) Too many books to monitor

D) All of the above

### Educational Threads

**Thread 1: Arbitrage 101**
```
1/ Most bettors lose money.

But there's a mathematically guaranteed way to profit.

It's called arbitrage betting.

Here's how it works (thread):

2/ Sportsbooks set their own odds.

Sometimes, their odds don't agree.

When Book A and Book B have different opinions,
sometimes you can bet BOTH sides and guarantee profit.

3/ Example:

Lakers vs Celtics

Book A: Lakers -110 / Celtics +120
Book B: Lakers +105 / Celtics -115

Bet $100 on Lakers at Book B (+105)
Bet $100 on Celtics at Book A (+120)

No matter who wins, you profit.

4/ The catch?

These opportunities last seconds.

By the time you manually check 5 books, the arb is gone.

That's why real-time monitoring is essential.

5/ We built @SportIntelHQ to solve this.

- Monitors 15+ sportsbooks
- Alerts you in real-time
- Shows exact bet amounts

Try it free: roizenlabs.com
```

**Thread 2: Steam Moves**
```
1/ Want to know where sharp money is going?

Watch for steam moves.

Here's what they are and how to profit from them:

2/ A "steam move" happens when a line moves suddenly across multiple books.

This usually means professional bettors (sharps) just placed big wagers.

3/ Here's the key insight:

Not all books move at the same speed.

If Book A moves first, you have SECONDS to bet Book B at the old line.

4/ Example:

Patriots -3 across all books

Sharp money hits Book A - line moves to -3.5

You have maybe 30 seconds to bet Patriots -3 at Book B before they adjust.

5/ This is the edge sharps have been using for years.

Now you can track it too.

SportIntel monitors line movements across 15+ books in real-time.

roizenlabs.com
```

### Engagement Tweets

```
Poll: How do you currently track odds?

[ ] Manually check each book
[ ] Use a comparison site
[ ] Spreadsheet alerts
[ ] Don't track at all
```

```
Hot take:

Most "betting systems" are just luck disguised as strategy.

The only guaranteed edge is math: arbitrage and +EV.

Agree or disagree?
```

```
If you could have ONE feature in a betting tool, what would it be?

## STEP 7: What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Don't buy followers** - Obvious and hurts credibility
2. **Don't just post links** - Add value in the tweet itself
3. **Don't ignore replies** - Respond to EVERYONE early on
4. **Don't be salesy** - 80% value, 20% promotion
5. **Don't post and ghost** - Engage for 30min after each tweet
6. **Don't argue with trolls** - Mute and move on
7. **Don't give betting tips** - Focus on tools, not picks

### Handle Negativity

**If someone says "this is a scam":**
```
Happy to show you how it works! The math behind arbitrage is
straightforward - different odds = different payouts.

Try the free tier and see for yourself: roizenlabs.com
```

**If someone says "arbs don't work anymore":**
```
They're definitely harder to find manually - that's the whole point.

We found 47 opportunities yesterday alone. They exist,
they're just gone in 60 seconds.

Real-time monitoring is the only way.
```
